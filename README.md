# Hi, I'm Daniel Dickerson

I'm a student developer looking to build a career in data engineering. I enjoy building cool projects and end-to-end solutions — from automating workflows with CLI tools to deploying real-time data processing systems and intelligent web apps. My projects often sit at the intersection of software engineering, data science, and on ocasion hardware.

## Interests & Strengths

- **Data Engineering** – ETL pipelines, data modeling, distributed systems, and transforming raw data into usable insights
- **AI & Neural Networks** – Building and training models for classification, contrastive learning, and pose analysis using PyTorch
- **Command-Line & Automation Tools** – Creating developer-first CLI apps to automate workflows and streamline processes
- **Systems Integration** – Bridging embedded devices, data pipelines, and backend systems in cohesive, purpose-driven projects
- **Project-Driven Learning** – I learn best by building tools that solve real-world problems from the ground up

## Selected Projects

### Smart Commit CLI  
A command-line tool that summarizes `git diff`s using the Gemini API and generates commit messages. Designed with persistent config support and flexible prompts for developer workflows.

### Pose Detection App  
Streamlit-based visualizer for pose tracking in fencing videos. Uses keypoint detection to plot joint trajectories over time — useful for performance analysis and motion segmentation.

### Foam Booth Data Analysis  
A data processing and analysis pipeline focused on customer purchase trends. Utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automatically tag and categorize transactional data, enhancing insights extraction. Built using Pandas and Matplotlib to identify sales patterns and customer segments.

## My Favourite Coursework

### Big Data  
Working with distributed datasets using MongoDB, implementing MapReduce workflows, and optimizing queries with indexing and multi-parameter sorting for efficient data retrieval and processing.

### AI for Text and Vision  
Implementing contrastive loss in Siamese networks and exploring Transformer models for classification tasks using PyTorch.  
The course also includes designing and training custom convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification (recognizing rock, paper, or scissors) and applying text preprocessing techniques such as TF-IDF for natural language tasks.

### Software Engineering (PACE Project)  
Collaborating on a web-based internal search platform using React, Supabase, and Vercel. The project aims to reduce the volume of unnecessary email requests to MQI staff by creating a user-friendly, Google-like interface that encourages self-service.  
Key features include Google Gemini-generated summaries of internal Notion pages and a data analytics dashboard highlighting common queries, enabling staff to proactively address documentation gaps.  
The system is designed and deployed entirely within free-tier constraints, emphasizing cost-effective architecture, scalable design, and real-world agile development practices.

> I use GitHub not just to publish polished work, but to learn in public — whether it's experimenting with hardware, deploying apps, or analyzing data flows. I'm particularly excited about building tools that make complex systems usable, insightful, and efficient.
